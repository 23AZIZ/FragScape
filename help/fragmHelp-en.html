<b>Description</b>

This step is optional
</span>
</br>
 This step allow user to integrate additional data to selected land cover classes.
</p><p>
<b>Parameters</b>
<br/>
 <i>Input layer</i> can be vector or raster.
<br/>
 If input layer is vector, user can specify a selection <i>Expression</i> (matching features are selected) and a <i>Buffer</i> (applied to selected features to modelize physical footprint). If expression is empty, all features are selected.
<br/>
 Choose a unique <i>Identifier</i> for current selection.
<br/>
 Set <i>Fragmentation status</i> according to data nature (roads are fragmentation data, green infrastructures are not).
<br/>
 Press <i>Save selection</i> to save current parameters (selections are then processed all at once) and rank resulting selection (new line in table) according to its priority.
 </p><p>
<b>Results</b>
<br/>
 Press <i>Integrate additional data</i> to process data selection and integration.
<br/>
 Each selection is processed (clip, selection, buffer) and resulting layer (with identifier name) is stored in temporary directory.
<br/>
 Selections are ranked (higher priority selection will erase lower priority selection) with interface arrows and merged with landuse layer (step 2 output). Resulting layer is loaded in QGIS.
