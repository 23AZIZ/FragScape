<b>Description</b>
<br/>
 This final step computes fragmentation metrics.
</p><p>
<b>Parameters</b>
<br/>
 <i>Input layer</i> is automatically updated when step 3 is performed and can be specified by user.
<br/>
 <i>Reporting layer</i> contains territory units for which fragmentation metrics are computed (e.g. metrics are computed for each feature of reporting layer).
 <i>Cross-Boundary Connection (CBC)</i> is an update of effective mesh size to mitigate "border effect" (natural patches clipped at administrative borders of the territory). See Jaeger article for further details.
<br/>
 Specify <i>Unit of area</i> for results metrics (by default results are rounded to 5 digits precision).
</p><p>
<b>Results</b>
<br/>
 Territory global effective mesh size is displayed in user interface.
<br/>
 Output layer with fragmentation metrics for each reporting unit is loaded in QGIS with an automatic graduated style according to effective mesh size value (from red for fragmented territories to green for less fragmented territories).
